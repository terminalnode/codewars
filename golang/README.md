# Codewars in Go
These are my exercises in Go. They're organized as a single go project created in GoLand, and uses
`go test` for testing.

As with all Codewars exercises I'm using this to familiarize myself with the language, as such
solutions and project structure may not follow all the best practices etc etc.
